# 3- Dimensional Tic-tac-toe Artificial Intelligence (using C++ and the SFML Library)
- Developed a program that simulates 3-Dimensional Tic-tac-toe game play between user and AI
- Implemented the mini-max algorithm so that the AI chooses the optimal move each time
- Used the SFML Library to create visuals for the game
- Collaborated with my computer science professor for feedback and suggested features
